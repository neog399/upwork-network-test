# Upwork network test project

An small coding exercise demonstrating the classic network reachability problem 
(whether a node in a network can be reached from a different node).

This project offers a common `Network` interface and two solutions to the problem:
* A naive Breadth-First-Search (BFS) based solution (see the `NetworkBFSImpl` class)
* A more sophisticated Disjoint-set based solution (see the `NetworkDisjointSetImpl` class)
